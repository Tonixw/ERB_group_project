              Limited and its parent companies, affiliates, subsidiaries and associated companies (“Group Companies”)
              (Everbloom Florals HK Limited and Group Companies are collectively referred to as “we” or “us”). This
              Privacy Policy will help you understand how we collect, use and safeguard your personal data in our
              interactions with you.</p><br>

            <p>Throughout this Privacy Policy, the term "personal data" means any data relating directly or indirectly
              to you, from which it is practicable for your identity to be directly or indirectly ascertained, and in a
              form in which access to or processing of the data is practicable.</p><br>

            <p>By visiting any website owned and operated by us (collectively, our “Site”) or providing us with your
